## What is this?

This is a databse I built with PostgreSQL and Node for a fictitious landscaping company, Los Angeles Landscaping & Gardening. The database has three endpoints, `/customers`, `/workers`, and `/orders`. It will serve as the backend for a fullstack project which includes a modern landing page (which captures customer info for `/customers`), a customer-facing order page where customers may view services and pricing and place an order (`/orders`), and a worker-facing order page where workers may view orders currentl in the database.

## Why build this?

I wanted to build a robust and secure backend to get more comfortable with PostgreSQL tables, writing tests, and building out a login feature (forthcoming).
