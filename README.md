# Express Boilerplate!

This is a boilerplate project used for starting new projects!

## What is this?

This is a database I built with PostgreSQL and Node for a fictitious landscaping company, Los Angeles Landscaping & Gardening. The database has three endpoints, `/customers`, `/workers`, and `/orders`. It will serve as the backend for a fullstack project which includes a modern landing page (which captures customer info for `/customers`), a customer-facing order page where customers may view services and pricing and place an order (`/orders`), and a worker-facing order page where workers may view orders currentl in the database.
